# SASS-Practice
Very Basic example of using SASS to its advantage

For this practice, we learned about using SASS, and how to use its basic properties.

The things we learned about are:
- Variable creation
- Partial files (allows for the ability of splitting styling into its own separate folders)
- nested properties

NOTE: This mini-project was NOT meant to showcase responsiveness, but rather only showcasing the use of a preprocessor

----------------------

Created a cool looking landing page for a make-up website named 'SASSY'. Project was made using SASS, where each SCSS file uses less than 50 lines of code. This allows for easy-to-follow code for others to look at.
